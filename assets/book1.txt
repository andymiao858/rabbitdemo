Enabling Offline Mode
Right now all the devices are not supporting offline speech input. However you can follow this discussion to enable offline speech input for supported devices.

I have downloaded speech input packages on my Nexus 5 and offline speech is working fine.

1. On your device go to Settings -> Language and Input. Click on icon on Google voice input.
2. Under ALL tab select the language you want to download.
3. Once the language package downloaded, you can see it under INSTALLED tab.
